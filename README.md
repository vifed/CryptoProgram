# CryptoProgram
An Academic project to apply some cryptographic methods such Transposition and Substitution.

The project are made using Java and Eclipse as IDE, to use the program run the Main class.

The program, for this version are made without user-interface.

In order to be able to use the program use the cmd line or the IDE and follow the istructions.

The text file that will be used by the program must be present inside the main folder of the project, for e.g /user/CryptoProgram/TextFile.txt

The program are made usuing Arch Linux OS and use the Unix unicode, so the result of the encryprion and/or decryption could be different using Windows OS.

The program are composed by four classes:

The Main class, that have the main function in order to run the program.

The OperationMan class, that handle the running of the program and the selection of the operations choosen by the users.

The Subtitution class, implements the encryption and decryption by using the substitution method.

The Transposition class, implements the encryption and decryption by using the transposition method.
